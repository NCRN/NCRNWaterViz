<p>This graph displays comparisons of water quality taken at streams in the National Parks of the National Capital Region Network. By using the "Commpare by" control, you can determine what sort of comaprison you wish to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Year:</b> Displays a different boxplot for each year. All data for each year will be included it the boxplot.</li>
  <li><b>Month:</b> Displays a different boxplot for each month. Data from all years contribute to each month's boxplot.</li>
  <li><b>Site:</b> Displays a different boxplot for each stream in the selected park. In some parks monitoring takes place in only a single stream, so in those cases only a single boxplot is displayed. </li>
</ul>

<p>Each boxplot gives you an idea of the range of water quality values for that year, site or stream. The bold line in the center of the box is the media value. The upper and lower boundaries of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles. Half of the data is within the box. The upper and lower verticak lines, called "whiskers", are each as long as 1.5 times the height of the box. Data outside the whiskers are outliers and are plotted as individual points. The width of the box depends solely on the number of boxes in the graph and otherwise conveys no information.</p> 

<h4>Water Quality Thresholds</h4>

<p>Many of the water quality parameters have established thresholds between good and poor water quality. Checking the "Water Qualtity Threshold Line"" box will display this threshold as a line on the graph,. References for water quality thresholds are found on the Citations & References tab.</p>
