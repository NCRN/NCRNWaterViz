<p>This map displays the locations of water quality sampling sites in the National Parks of the National Capital Region Network. You can also display nearby USGS gaging staitons.</p>

<h4> NPS Sites</h4>
<p> When mapping NPS monitoring sites you can pick a water quality characteristic to map. Each monitoring site will be drawn as a circle. The color of the circle will indicate the % of water quality measurements that meet water quality standards. Only characteristics with defined thresholds are avaialbe for mapping. Clicking on point will show additional informaiton. Citations for the water quality thresholds can be found under the Citations & References tab. </p>

<h4> USGS Gaging Stations</h4>
<p> Checking the USGS Gaging Station checkbox will download and map data from Gaging stations near the parks, and those on major rivers that flow through the parks. This download can be slow, so please be patient. Each gaging station will be mapped as a ring shaped symbol. The latest dischage reading is compared to historaical data from the same date in previoue years. The color of the ring indicates how high or low discharge is at each staion, compared to the historical data. For some gages, discharge has not been measured long enough to establish 5th or 95th percentiles. In these cases any dischage under the 25th percentile is labled "5th-25 percentile" and any discharge over the 75th percentile is labeled "75th-95th percentile". Clicking on a gaging staiton will show the latest discharge value and a link to the station's USGS webpage. </p>
