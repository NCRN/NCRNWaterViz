<p>This graph displays measurements of water quality taken at streams in the National Parks of the National Capital Region Network. Each point on a graph indicates the measurement of water quality for that particular stream at that time. By default, all available data will be displayed. Monitoring began at different times for different streams and water quality parameters, so not all combinations have the same amount of data. The Project Informaiton tab includes a description of each water quality parameter, and the locaiton of each monitoring site can be found on the Map tab.</p> 

<h4>Water Quality Thresholds</h4>

<p>Many of the water quality parameters have established thresholds between good and poor water quality. Checking the "Water Qualtity Threshold Line" box will display this threshold on the graph, and checking the "Indicate Points with Poor Water Quality" box will change the color of points with poor water quality. References for water quality thresholds are found on the Citations & References tab.</p>
    
<h4>Trends and Seasonal Patterns</h4>

<p>Checking the "Show Seasonal Patterns and Trends" box will display the results of a trend analysis of the data. First a cosinor regression is performed to determine if there is seasonality in the data. If seasonality is found then the results of this analysis are displayed. If there is no seasonality than a simple linerar regression is performed. This regression is then dispalyed and text below hte graph indicats if a signficant regression was found. For both analyses, points that are found to have a studentized residual greater than 4 are assumed to be outliers. The analysis is then rerun without this points. Checking the `Indicate Outliers Not Used in Analysis` box will circle these points.</p>
